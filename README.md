## How to Use

### Options

1. Use Slash Command  
 
   Place your cursor in a block and execute the slash command by typing `asset` and selecting "Insert a local asset file." A box for asset selection will appear.

2. Use Shortcut Key

   Place your cursor in a block and execute the shortcut key. The default key settings are `ctrl+Shift+O` (Windows) or `cmd+Shift+O` (Mac), but you can customize them from the key bindings.
   > If the cursor position does not exist, the file is opened on the OS without being inserted into any blocks.

### Asset Selection

Cursor keys can be used for navigation.
